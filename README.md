# Consvidlatête-19


## Overview
Because of confinement, many people are bored at home. We offer a fun app to help them keep busy productively, learning new skills, through a list of challenges, via a very user-friendly app. 

## How to use

* Install node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* Run build.gradle (./back/build.gradle)
* npm install (In the /front repository)
* npm start
* If you are on an iOS phone, scan the QR code
  If you are on an android phone, scan the QR code with the app Expo
* Put your IP address where it was hardcoded in the project (./front/api.js)
  
## User guide
The porting of the application to Android/iOS is in construction. 
For the moment, here is an overview of the app :
